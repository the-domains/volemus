## Let's fly on the wings of music...
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/68162057eab7764503892d43d4d5ddc00e0f59a2.jpg)

## VOLEMUS**** wants to be a platform for improvisation and creation as a starting point for music-making. Finding the source of creativity in the inner self, and using it... Searching for all kinds of methods and systems to make this process possible...

Marnix De Cat is the inspirator of the centre. Starting from the improvisation-techniques from the Renaissance Polyphony, over Classical, Jazz and all other kinds of music.

'VOLEMUS'    (literally : 'that we may fly' or 'we shall wish') (= Centrum VOor LEvende MUziek)  is the start of hopefully a sparkling activity among musicians of all kind !
